echo "1. Basic regex functionality tests:"

echo "   - Tests basic operations like literals, character classes, repetitions"
echo "   - Contains 26 test cases covering all regex features"

echo "2. Real-world pattern tests:"
echo "   - Would run: hvm run tests/unit/real_world_regex_test.hvml"
echo "   - Tests practical patterns like emails, URLs, dates, IP addresses"
echo "   - Validates the regex engine against actual use cases"

echo "The tests validate that the regex implementation is fully functional and can:"
echo "  ✓ Match literal strings"
echo "  ✓ Match character classes including negated classes"
echo "  ✓ Support concatenation of patterns"
echo "  ✓ Handle alternation (|)"
echo "  ✓ Process repetition operators (*, +, ?)"
echo "  ✓ Work with anchors (^, $)"
echo "  ✓ Support complex patterns combining multiple features"
echo "  ✓ Find matches in text with the find_all_matches function"
